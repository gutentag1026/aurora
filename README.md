Dm  Bb  F  C


[Verse]
Dm        Bb                F         C
   Do you know what's worth fighting for,
Dm           Bb        F      C
   When it's not worth dying for?
Dm         Bb        F        C
   Does it take your breath away
        Bb                  C
And you feel yourself suffocating?
Dm          Bb         F         C
   Does the pain weigh out the pride?
Dm         Bb         F         C
   And you look for a place to hide?
Dm         Bb             F        C
   Did someone break your heart inside?
           Bb         C5
You're in ruins


[Chorus]
F5   C/E  D5
One, 21 guns
C5             Bb5
Lay down your arms
F5           C5
Give up the fight
F5   C/E  D5
One, 21 guns
C5             Bb5 F5        C5
Throw up your arms into the sky,
        Bb5  F5  C5
You and I


[Verse]
Dm             Bb     F           C
   When you're at the end of the road
Dm         Bb       F            C
   And you lost all sense of control
Dm          Bb            F            C
   And your thoughts have taken their toll
          Bb                             C
When your mind breaks the spirit of your soul
Dm      Bb             F       C
   Your faith walks on broken glass
Dm         Bb       F        C
   And the hangover doesn't pass
Dm           Bb   F         C
   Nothing's ever built to last
           Bb         C5
You're in ruins.

You and I


[Bridge]
D5         Bb5    F5            C5
   Did you try to live on your own
D5          Bb5             F5         A5
   When you burned down the house and home?
D5         Bb5       F5            A5
   Did you stand too close to the fire?
       Bb5                  C5              F5
Like a liar looking for forgiveness from a stone

Dm           Bb      F             C
   When it's time to live and let die
Dm         Bb         F       C
   And you can't get another try
Dm           Bb          F          C
   Something inside this heart has died
           Bb
You're in ruins.

## Traveling Lights

Intro:    A E B C#m

(verse)              A                 E
          Well I was doublin' over the load on my shoulders
                B                        C#m
          Was a weight I carried with me everyday
                   A                         E
          Crossin' miles of frustrations and rivers a ragin'
          B                         C#m
          Pickin' up stones I found along the way


            A
          I staggered and I stumbled down
          E
          Pathways of trouble
                B                          C#m
          I was haulin' those souvenirs of misery
                   A                   E
          And with each step takin' my back was breakin'
           B                                      C#m
          'Til found the One who took it all from me

(chorus)              A          E
          Down by the riverside (Down by the riverside)
                    B
          I laid my burdens down,
                  C#m
          Now I'm travelin' light
                    A            E
          My spirit lifted high (I found my freedom now)
                     B
          I found my freedom now,
                  C#m
          And I'm travelin' light

(verse)               A                  E
          Through the darkest alleys and loneliest valleys
                B                              C#m
          I was draggin' those heavy chains of doubt and fear
                    A                   E
          Then with one word spoken the locks were broken
                   B
          Now He's leading me to places
                             C#m
          Where there are no tears

(Repeat chorus)
