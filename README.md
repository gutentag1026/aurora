## Hero
```
[Verse 1]

          G
Would you dance,
                  Em
If I asked you to dance?
          C
Would you run,
               D
And never look back?
          G
Would you cry,
              Em
If you saw me crying?
          C       D      G
Would you save my soul tonight?


[Verse 2]

          G
Would you tremble
                  Em
If I touched your lips?
          C
Would you laugh,
                  D
Oh please tell me this.
              G
Now would you die,
                Em
For the one you love.
        C       D      G
Hold me in your arms tonight.


[Chorus]

G     D             C
I can be your hero, baby.
G     D             C
I can kiss away the pain.
G      D               C
I will stand by you forever.
G       D       C
You can take my breath away.


[Verse 3]

          G
Would you swear,
                      Em
That you'll always be mine?
          C
Would you lie,
                   D
Would you run and hide?
            G
Am I in too deep?
               Em
Have I lost my mind?
        C            D      G
I don't care, you're here tonight.


[Chorus]

G     D             C       G

[Verse 1]
          G        Em
I found a love for me
              C                            D
Darling, just dive right in, and follow my lead
                G          Em
Well, I found a girl beautiful and sweet
        C                                     D
I never knew you were the someone waiting for me

[Pre-Chorus]
                                G
Cause we were just kids when we fell in love
            Em                      C                G  D
Not knowing what it was, I will not give you up this ti-ime
             G                           Em
Darling just kiss me slow, your heart is all I own
            C                     D
And in your eyes you're holding mine

[Chorus]
      Em   C             G          D              Em
Baby, I'm dancing in the dark, with you between my arms
C                G     D                Em
Barefoot on the grass, listening to our favourite song
          C                G                 D              F
When you said you looked a mess, I whispered underneath my breath
         C                G        D             G
But you heard it, darling you look perfect tonight

| G D/G Em D | C  D  |

[Verse 2]
                G                    Em
Well, I found a woman, stronger than anyone I know
              C                                          D
She shares my dreams, I hope that someday I'll share her home
           G             Em
I found a love, to carry more than just my secrets
         C                              D
To carry love, to carry children of our own

[Pre-Chorus]
                             G                     Em
We are still kids, but we're so in love, fighting against all odds
             C               G  D
I know we'll be alright this ti-ime
             G                              Em
Darling just hold my hand, be my girl, I'll be your man
         C               D
I see my future in your eyes

[Chorus]
      Em   C              G         D              Em
Baby, I'm dancing in the dark, with you between my arms
C                G     D                Em
Barefoot on the grass, listening to our favourite song
        C                G                D
When I saw you in that dress, looking so beautiful
  Em       C                  G        D          [ G ]
I don't deserve this, darling you look perfect tonight

Baby, I'm dancing in the dark, with you between my arms
C                G     D                Em
Barefoot on the grass, listening to our favourite song
        C              G               D             Em
I have faith in what I see, now I know I have met an angel

In person, and she looks perfect

   Do you know what's worth fighting for,
Dm           Bb        F      C
   When it's not worth dying for?
Dm         Bb        F        C
   Does it take your breath away

[Verse]
Dm             Bb     F           C
   When you're at the end of the road

   And you lost all sense of control
Dm          Bb            F            C
   And your thoughts have taken their toll

When your mind breaks the spirit of your soul
Dm      Bb             F       C
   Your faith walks on broken glass
Dm         Bb       F        C
   And the hangover doesn't pass

   Did you try to live on your own
D5          Bb5             F5         A5
   When you burned down the house and home?
D5         Bb5       F5            A5
   Did you stand too close to the fire?

          My spirit lifted high (I found my freedom now)
                     B
          I found my freedom now,
                  C#m
          And I'm travelin' light

(verse)               A                  E
          Through the darkest alleys and loneliest valleys
                B                              C#m
          I was draggin' those heavy chains of doubt and fear
                    A                   E
          Then with one word spoken the locks were broken
                   B
          Now He's leading me to places
                             C#m
          Where there are no tears

(Repeat chorus)
```
